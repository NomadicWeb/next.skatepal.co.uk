We are currently in the development stages of delivering the new SkatePAL[[1]] website
and our latest efforts are staged here[[2]].

TODO
====
  - clean up content on existing site
    - project filter working
    - team filters working
  - Add Donate button - Martin (the bud is medical)
  - Implement translations
  - Add links to twitter, facebook and youtube tooltips at side
  - Add Timmy and Sams face in team
  - Remove Google API calls from the head. Only load on project page
  - Figure out how to update the pages on the site (without nuking all content)
    - for example, I have fixed the about-us page, but I can't upload the new
      code ... what to do?
