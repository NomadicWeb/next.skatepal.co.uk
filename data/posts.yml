    teaser: "Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."

It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.  Ye-ha! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I'm trying not to, kid."
